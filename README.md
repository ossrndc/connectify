- Create individual PR for each suggestion.

#### Creating A Pull Request:

1. Fork the Project:

      As explained by us during event, by forking a project, you simply make a copy of the project in your github repo.

      why it is necessary? Because it allows us to make changes which ever you want. Moreover, it allows you to generate PRs, to the original repo from your repo.

      Still any abouts? Ask the volunteers or authors !! We are here to help you.
